Blurb: Our research group has a couple of exciting projects on using quantum computing to accelerate computational cognitive neuroscience. The first project involves developing quantum implementations of an attention allocation optimization problem that is central to many cognitive models. We have an initial quantum annealing implementation developed by an undergrad in the previous semester, that students could build on. The second project involves developing a quantum random walk implementation of a decision-making model. Conventionally, decision-making has been studied using drift diffusion models. For both projects, we would like to evaluate multiple implementations to understand the tradeoffs and identify the best variant(s). There is one undergrad working on this project since the last semester and we are looking for another student. It is preferable that students have a light background on quantum computing. This is a great opportunity to interact with computer scientists, cognitive neuroscientists and quantum physicists.

A ‘second quantum revolution’ is now underway based on our relatively new understanding of how information can be stored, manipulated and communicated using strange quantum hardware that is neither fully digital nor fully analog. We now realize that 20th century hardware does not take advantage of the full power of quantum machines. This talk will give a gentle introduction to the basic concepts that underlie this quantum information revolution and describe recent remarkable experimental progress in the race to build quantum machines for computing, sensing and communication.\nPrerequisites: No prior knowledge of quantum mechanics is required!\n ","date":"2021-01-17T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://yaleqc.github.io/p/speaker-series-spring-2021/","title":"Speaker Series (Spring 2021)"},{"content":"Please take a moment to explore our site and read this post from our Fall 2020 interest meeting to learn a bit more about our organization.

Much more coming soon.\nQuantum Information  Physics 345: Introduction to Quantum Information Processing and Communication, Prof Steven Girvin  Who should take it: Anyone with a knowledge of complex numbers and introductory linear algebra. This course presents a very accessible and exciting foray into quantum information science. This is highly recommended to anyone looking to begin their journey with quantum computing, with or without a technical physics background. When is/was it offered: Spring 2021 What does it cover: Begins with a basic overview of quantum phenomena and covers the mathematical representation of quantum states as complex vectors, the superposition principle, entanglement and Bell inequalities, quantum gates and algorithms for quantum computers, quantum error correction, dense coding, teleportation, and secure quantum communication. The course also includes an introductory overview of how to use IBM Q.   Physics 660: Quantum Information and Computation, Prof Shruti Puri  Who should take it: This is effectively the graduate version of Phys 345, and should be treated as such. The audience spans advanced undergraduates to graduate students. That said, Prof Puri makes every effort to start from first principles, making this course accessible to undergraduates and even motivated non-Physics majors. When is/was it offered: Fall 2020 What does it cover: This course covers a wide range of topics ranging quantum circuits, universality, physical implementation of quantum operations, introduction to computational complexity, quantum algorithms, decoherence and noisy quantum channels, quantum error-correction and fault-tolerance, stabilizer formalism, error-correcting codes (Shor, Steane, surface-code, and others as time permits), quantum key distribution, quantum Shannon theory, entropy and data compression.    Experimental Physics  Physics 677: Noise, Dissipation, Amplification, and Information, Prof Michel Devoret  Who should take it: This is a difficult graduate course accessible to undergraduates with an advanced background in at least quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and electromagnetism. Some background in solid state physics and/or quantum many body theory could be helpful, but is not required. This should be taken by students interested in conducting experimental research in fields such as superconducting circuit quantum computing. When is/was it offered: Fall 2020 What does it cover: Physics explores phenomena displayed by simple systems through well-controlled experiments, whose results inform conceptual models. Central to these experiments are measurements of the system properties under varying conditions. In one form or another, measurements is performed by perturbing the system under study by a stimulus signal, and collecting the response signal. Acquiring the most precise information on a phenomenon of interest thus consists of maximizing the response signal and minimizing its accompanying noise. But what exactly is noise? Can noise itself have remarkable and worthwhile properties despite its fundamental uncertain character? How can we mitigate its effects? The aim of this graduate-level course is to answer these questions, with emphasis on the case where the origin of noise is thermal or quantum fluctuations. These fluctuations are unavoidable for a system under measurement, which is by essence open, and fundamentally different from closed system studied in undergraduate courses. The fundamental fluctuations affecting measurements cannot be addressed by ordinary filters or shields, and have to be faced head-on. Of particular interest are the fluctuations inherent in the control and signal processing of the experiment itself. Thus, dissipation and amplification, important effects in operations involved in the measurement and control chains, are ultimately linked to noise. The form of the link is the essence of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT), which was first uncovered by Einstein. Students will learn the concepts and main tools of the analysis of stochastic processes and information theory, through the exploration of FDT and all its main applications.

Terra provides a bedrock for composing quantum programs at the level of circuits and pulses, to optimize them for the constraints of a particular device, and to manage the execution of batches of experiments on remote-access devices. Terra defines the interfaces for a desirable end-user experience, as well as the efficient handling of layers of optimization, pulse scheduling and backend communication. Aer: Aer, the ‘air’ element, permeates all Qiskit elements. To really speed up development of quantum computers we need better simulators, emulators and debuggers. Aer helps us understand the limits of classical processors by demonstrating to what extent they can mimic quantum computation Ignis: Ignis, the ‘fire’ element, is dedicated to fighting noise and errors and to forging a new path. This includes better characterization of errors, improving gates, and computing in the presence of noise. Ignis is meant for those who want to design quantum error correction codes, or who wish to study ways to characterize errors through methods such as tomography, or even to find a better way for using gates by exploring dynamical decoupling and optimal control. Aqua: Aqua, the ‘water’ element, is the element of life. To make quantum computing live up to its expectations, we need to find real-world applications. Aqua is where algorithms for quantum computers are built. These algorithms can be used to build applications for quantum computing. Aqua is accessible to domain experts in chemistry, optimization, finance and AI, who want to explore the benefits of using quantum computers as accelerators for specific computational tasks.

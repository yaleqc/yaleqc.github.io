Blurb: Our research group has a couple of exciting projects on using quantum computing to accelerate computational cognitive neuroscience. The first project involves developing quantum implementations of an attention allocation optimization problem that is central to many cognitive models. We have an initial quantum annealing implementation developed by an undergrad in the previous semester, that students could build on. The second project involves developing a quantum random walk implementation of a decision-making model. Conventionally, decision-making has been studied using drift diffusion models. For both projects, we would like to evaluate multiple implementations to understand the tradeoffs and identify the best variant(s). There is one undergrad working on this project since the last semester and we are looking for another student. It is preferable that students have a light background on quantum computing. This is a great opportunity to interact with computer scientists, cognitive neuroscientists and quantum physicists.

W. Beinecke Professor of Applied Physics at Yale University (which he joined in 2002), Prof. Michel Devoret focuses his research on experimental solid state physics with emphasis on quantum mechanical electronics or \u0026ldquo;quantronics\u0026rdquo;. In this new type of electronics, electrical collective degrees of freedom like currents and voltages behave quantum mechanically. Such mesoscopic phenomena are particularly important in the realization of quantum information processing superconducting devices based on Josephson junctions, which is his main research goal.\nAbstract: The accuracy of logical operations on quantum bits (qubits) must be improved for quantum computers to surpass classical ones in useful tasks. To that effect, quantum information must be robust to noise that affects the underlying physical system. Rather than completely suppressing noise, quantum error correction aims at preventing it from causing logical errors. This approach derives from the reasonable assumption that noise is local: it does not act in a coordinated way on different parts of the physical system. Therefore, if a logical qubit is encoded non-locally, it is possible, during a limited time, to detect and correct noise-induced evolution before it corrupts the encoded information. We will discuss how recent experiments based on superconducting cavities and transmon artificial atoms - employed here as ancillary non-linear elements - realize error correction, and their prospect for autonomous error correction, without which scaling up will be essentially impossible.\nStudents in Quantum Night March 17, 8-9PM ET The YuQC Speaker Series is happy to announce Students in Quantum night. This speaker event will feature brief (~10-15mins) research presentations from Yale undergraduate student researchers. Stay tuned for our speaker list, and look forward to learning more about undergraduate research efforts in quantum computation and quantum engineering at Yale.\nProf. Liang Jiang, UChicago The Era of Quantum Information February 23rd, 7PM ET Prof. Liang Jiang joined the faculty of Yale University as an assistant professor in 2012, and later as an associate professor of Applied Physics. In 2019, Prof. Jiang moved to his current position as professor at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. There, he theoretically investigates quantum systems and explores various quantum applications, such as quantum sensing, quantum transduction, quantum communication, and quantum computation.\nAbstract: In this talk, Prof. Jiang will talk about the advances in quantum communication and various quantum applications.\nProf. Steven Girvin, Yale The Second Quantum Revolution and the Race to Build ‘Impossible’ Computers February 9th, 7PM ET Professor Steven Girvin is a Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Yale, and the Director of the Co-Design Center for Quantum Advantage at Brookhaven National Laboratory.\nAbstract: The first quantum revolution brought us the great technological advances of the 20th century—the transistor, the laser, the atomic clock and GPS, the global positioning system. A ‘second quantum revolution’ is now underway based on our relatively new understanding of how information can be stored, manipulated and communicated using strange quantum hardware that is neither fully digital nor fully analog. We now realize that 20th century hardware does not take advantage of the full power of quantum machines. This talk will give a gentle introduction to the basic concepts that underlie this quantum information revolution and describe recent remarkable experimental progress in the race to build quantum machines for computing, sensing and communication.\nPrerequisites: No prior knowledge of quantum mechanics is required!\n ","date":"2021-03-11T00:00:00Z","image":"https://yaleqc.com/p/speaker-series-spring-2021/background_hu1b985ef13ee2df9aee4392d3ead09e9b_279945_120x120_fill_box_smart1_2.png","permalink":"https://yaleqc.com/p/speaker-series-spring-2021/","title":"Speaker Series (Spring 2021)"},{"content":"Status  About We are going through an edX course titled \u0026ldquo;Quantum Cryptography\u0026rdquo; to gain knowledge and experience in the field.

Much more coming soon.\nQuantum Information  Physics 345: Introduction to Quantum Information Processing and Communication, Prof Steven Girvin  Who should take it: Anyone with a knowledge of complex numbers and introductory linear algebra. This course presents a very accessible and exciting foray into quantum information science. This is highly recommended to anyone looking to begin their journey with quantum computing, with or without a technical physics background. When is/was it offered: Spring 2021 What does it cover: Begins with a basic overview of quantum phenomena and covers the mathematical representation of quantum states as complex vectors, the superposition principle, entanglement and Bell inequalities, quantum gates and algorithms for quantum computers, quantum error correction, dense coding, teleportation, and secure quantum communication. The course also includes an introductory overview of how to use IBM Q.   Physics 660: Quantum Information and Computation, Prof Shruti Puri  Who should take it: This is effectively the graduate version of Phys 345, and should be treated as such. The audience spans advanced undergraduates to graduate students. That said, Prof Puri makes every effort to start from first principles, making this course accessible to undergraduates and even motivated non-Physics majors. When is/was it offered: Fall 2020 What does it cover: This course covers a wide range of topics ranging quantum circuits, universality, physical implementation of quantum operations, introduction to computational complexity, quantum algorithms, decoherence and noisy quantum channels, quantum error-correction and fault-tolerance, stabilizer formalism, error-correcting codes (Shor, Steane, surface-code, and others as time permits), quantum key distribution, quantum Shannon theory, entropy and data compression.    Experimental Physics  Physics 677: Noise, Dissipation, Amplification, and Information, Prof Michel Devoret  Who should take it: This is a difficult graduate course accessible to undergraduates with an advanced background in at least quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and electromagnetism. Some background in solid state physics and/or quantum many body theory could be helpful, but is not required. This should be taken by students interested in conducting experimental research in fields such as superconducting circuit quantum computing. When is/was it offered: Fall 2020 What does it cover: Physics explores phenomena displayed by simple systems through well-controlled experiments, whose results inform conceptual models. Central to these experiments are measurements of the system properties under varying conditions. In one form or another, measurements is performed by perturbing the system under study by a stimulus signal, and collecting the response signal. Acquiring the most precise information on a phenomenon of interest thus consists of maximizing the response signal and minimizing its accompanying noise. But what exactly is noise? Can noise itself have remarkable and worthwhile properties despite its fundamental uncertain character? How can we mitigate its effects? The aim of this graduate-level course is to answer these questions, with emphasis on the case where the origin of noise is thermal or quantum fluctuations. These fluctuations are unavoidable for a system under measurement, which is by essence open, and fundamentally different from closed system studied in undergraduate courses. The fundamental fluctuations affecting measurements cannot be addressed by ordinary filters or shields, and have to be faced head-on. Of particular interest are the fluctuations inherent in the control and signal processing of the experiment itself. Thus, dissipation and amplification, important effects in operations involved in the measurement and control chains, are ultimately linked to noise. The form of the link is the essence of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT), which was first uncovered by Einstein. Students will learn the concepts and main tools of the analysis of stochastic processes and information theory, through the exploration of FDT and all its main applications.

There is a vibrant community of open source developers and quantum advocates.\nGetting Started Join the Qiskit slack!\nHere are some curated tutorials to get yourself started with Qiskit and the IBM Quantum Experience:\n Code your first quantum circuit CH 1-3 of Qiskit Textbook Beginner Tutorials  Events Stay up to date with Qiskit events.\nPast events:\n Hackathons IBM Qiskit Global Summer School  Quantum Advocates Apply to become one of ~200 Quantum Advocate across ~30 countries at IBM. Learn more at qiskit.org/advocates!\nBenefits\n Network with experts and enthusiasts Access to Qiskit core members and projects Increased visibility for your work Invitation to events  Resources One of the huge advantages of using Qiskit, especially as a beginner, is its comprehensive set of documentation, tutorials and community resources, most notably including the Qiskit Textbook.\nGithub Contribute to the Qiskit elements on their official Github!\n Terra: Terra, the ‘earth’ element, is the foundation on which the rest of Qiskit lies. Terra provides a bedrock for composing quantum programs at the level of circuits and pulses, to optimize them for the constraints of a particular device, and to manage the execution of batches of experiments on remote-access devices. Terra defines the interfaces for a desirable end-user experience, as well as the efficient handling of layers of optimization, pulse scheduling and backend communication. Aer: Aer, the ‘air’ element, permeates all Qiskit elements. To really speed up development of quantum computers we need better simulators, emulators and debuggers. Aer helps us understand the limits of classical processors by demonstrating to what extent they can mimic quantum computation Ignis: Ignis, the ‘fire’ element, is dedicated to fighting noise and errors and to forging a new path. This includes better characterization of errors, improving gates, and computing in the presence of noise. Ignis is meant for those who want to design quantum error correction codes, or who wish to study ways to characterize errors through methods such as tomography, or even to find a better way for using gates by exploring dynamical decoupling and optimal control. Aqua: Aqua, the ‘water’ element, is the element of life. To make quantum computing live up to its expectations, we need to find real-world applications. Aqua is where algorithms for quantum computers are built. These algorithms can be used to build applications for quantum computing. Aqua is accessible to domain experts in chemistry, optimization, finance and AI, who want to explore the benefits of using quantum computers as accelerators for specific computational tasks.

Blurb: Our research group has a couple of exciting projects on using quantum computing to accelerate computational cognitive neuroscience. The first project involves developing quantum implementations of an attention allocation optimization problem that is central to many cognitive models. We have an initial quantum annealing implementation developed by an undergrad in the previous semester, that students could build on. The second project involves developing a quantum random walk implementation of a decision-making model. Conventionally, decision-making has been studied using drift diffusion models. For both projects, we would like to evaluate multiple implementations to understand the tradeoffs and identify the best variant(s). There is one undergrad working on this project since the last semester and we are looking for another student. It is preferable that students have a light background on quantum computing. This is a great opportunity to interact with computer scientists, cognitive neuroscientists and quantum physicists.

Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look back at our productive year!\nMembers As shown through data collected at our interest meeting, YuQC brought together students from across disciplines, school years, and experience levels. This diversity was fundamental to our success.\n  Projects To become a member of YuQC, a student would have to commit to at least one initiative. Many of these initiatives took the form of study groups and open-source projects, including:\n qtcodes quantum programming API quantum cryptography study group quantum error correction study group  Quantum Coalition \u0026amp; Partnerships \u0026amp; Outreach YuQC partnered with the Stanford QCA to organize the Quantum Coalition Hackathon, sponsored by IBM, Q-CTRL, Google, Microsoft, IonQ, qBraid, Xanadu, QFarm, YQI, and StrangeWorks.\nThis student-planned hackathon saw 1.4K participants from 80 countries, 200 project submissions, and 22 hours of workshops. Moreover, this event kickstarted the Quantum Coalition, a platform for collaboration between quantum computing clubs from across the world.\nBeyond the Quantum Coalition, we also collaborated with several Yale clubs, including events with Yale Society of Physics Students and Yale Women in Physics, and high school outreach with TECHY from YHACK.\n  Speaker Series Consistent with our mission to make Quantum Computing accessible to undergraduates, we created an undergrad-accessible speaker series featuring talks (found here) by Prof. Steven Girvin, Prof. Liang Jiang, members of YuQC, Prof. Michel Devoret, Prof. Raymond Laflamme, and Dr. Zlatko Minev.\n  Social Hours A large part of building the YuQC community was done during our social hours, which alternated with biweekly club meetings and explored everything from experimental quantum computing lab tours to quantum chess.\n  Resources Throughout the year, we compiled a database of resources and maintained a weekly updated opportunities bulletin, among other resources found here.\nBoard | Project Leaders | Mentors None of this, however, could have been done without our talented and committed board, project leaders, mentors, and membership.\nHuge thank you to you all!\n2020-21 Board\n  2020-21 Project Leaders\n  2020-21 Mentors\n  ","date":"2021-05-20T00:00:00Z","image":"https://yaleqc.com/p/recap-2020-21/background_hue9dfda9f0464fb7605dc9fba62165a3b_235209_120x120_fill_box_smart1_2.png","permalink":"https://yaleqc.com/p/recap-2020-21/","title":"Recap 2020-21"},{"content":"Here is a summary and schedule of the YuQC Speaker Series.\n Information \u0026amp; Recordings Check out this Youtube playlist of all past talk recordings!!\nPlease click here (yale.edu account required) to access zoom links, meeting passwords, and, eventually, recordings for this speaker series.\n Dr. Zlatko Minev To catch and reverse a quantum jump mid-flight April 21, 7:00PM-8:00PM ET Dr. Minev is a scientist with an applied experimental and theoretical background, focused on quantum computing and fundamental physics. He holds a permanent research position at IBM Quantum, at TJ Watson. Dr. Minev received his Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Yale University, working in the Devoret Quantum Lab.\nAbstract: Quantum physics was invented to account for two fundamental features of measurement results \u0026ndash; their discreetness and randomness. Emblematic of these features is Bohr\u0026rsquo;s idea of quantum jumps between two discrete energy levels of an atom. Experimentally, quantum jumps were first observed in an atomic ion driven by a weak deterministic force while under strong continuous energy measurement. The times at which the discontinuous jump transitions occur are reputed to be fundamentally unpredictable. Can there be, despite the indeterminism of quantum physics, a possibility to know if a quantum jump is about to occur or not? Here, we answer this question affirmatively by experimentally demonstrating that the jump from the ground to an excited state of a superconducting artificial three-level atom can be tracked as it follows a predictable \u0026ldquo;flight,\u0026rdquo; by monitoring the population of an auxiliary energy level coupled to the ground state. The experimental results demonstrate that the jump evolution when completed is continuous, coherent, and deterministic. Furthermore, exploiting these features and using real-time monitoring and feedback, we catch and reverse a quantum jump mid-flight, thus deterministically preventing its completion. Our results, which agree with theoretical predictions essentially without adjustable parameters, support the modern quantum trajectory theory and provide new ground for the exploration of real-time intervention techniques in the control of quantum systems, such as early detection of error syndromes.\nProf. Raymond Laflamme Fireside Chat April 8, 7:00PM-8:00PM ET Professor Raymond Laflamme is the founder of the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo and a Canada Research Chair in Quantum Computing. Prof. Laflamme began his career working with Stephen Hawking on questions in quantum gravity and cosmology, but his interests have moved to quantum information science and technology. As a pioneering scientist in quantum information theory. Prof. Laflamme laid down the mathematical framework for quantum error-correcting codes, which has since grown into the incredibly vibrant field we know today.\nAbstract: As a part of the YuQC speaker series, Prof. Ray Laflamme will join us this Thursday (April 8th) at 7pm for a fireside chat. This will be an incredibly unique opportunity for you to ask one of the biggest names in quantum anything you\u0026rsquo;d like!\nProf. Michel Devoret Error correction of logical quantum bits March 26, 6:30PM-7:30PM ET Currently the F. W. Beinecke Professor of Applied Physics at Yale University (which he joined in 2002), Prof. Michel Devoret focuses his research on experimental solid state physics with emphasis on quantum mechanical electronics or \u0026ldquo;quantronics\u0026rdquo;. In this new type of electronics, electrical collective degrees of freedom like currents and voltages behave quantum mechanically. Such mesoscopic phenomena are particularly important in the realization of quantum information processing superconducting devices based on Josephson junctions, which is his main research goal.\nAbstract: The accuracy of logical operations on quantum bits (qubits) must be improved for quantum computers to surpass classical ones in useful tasks. To that effect, quantum information must be robust to noise that affects the underlying physical system. Rather than completely suppressing noise, quantum error correction aims at preventing it from causing logical errors. This approach derives from the reasonable assumption that noise is local: it does not act in a coordinated way on different parts of the physical system. Therefore, if a logical qubit is encoded non-locally, it is possible, during a limited time, to detect and correct noise-induced evolution before it corrupts the encoded information. We will discuss how recent experiments based on superconducting cavities and transmon artificial atoms - employed here as ancillary non-linear elements - realize error correction, and their prospect for autonomous error correction, without which scaling up will be essentially impossible.\nStudents in Quantum Night March 17, 8-9PM ET The YuQC Speaker Series is happy to announce Students in Quantum night. This speaker event will feature brief (~10-15mins) research presentations from Yale undergraduate student researchers. Stay tuned for our speaker list, and look forward to learning more about undergraduate research efforts in quantum computation and quantum engineering at Yale.\nProf. Liang Jiang, UChicago The Era of Quantum Information February 23rd, 7PM ET Prof. Liang Jiang joined the faculty of Yale University as an assistant professor in 2012, and later as an associate professor of Applied Physics. In 2019, Prof. Jiang moved to his current position as professor at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. There, he theoretically investigates quantum systems and explores various quantum applications, such as quantum sensing, quantum transduction, quantum communication, and quantum computation.\nAbstract: In this talk, Prof. Jiang will talk about the advances in quantum communication and various quantum applications.\n  Prof. Steven Girvin, Yale The Second Quantum Revolution and the Race to Build ‘Impossible’ Computers February 9th, 7PM ET Professor Steven Girvin is a Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Yale, and the Director of the Co-Design Center for Quantum Advantage at Brookhaven National Laboratory.\nAbstract: The first quantum revolution brought us the great technological advances of the 20th century—the transistor, the laser, the atomic clock and GPS, the global positioning system. A ‘second quantum revolution’ is now underway based on our relatively new understanding of how information can be stored, manipulated and communicated using strange quantum hardware that is neither fully digital nor fully analog. We now realize that 20th century hardware does not take advantage of the full power of quantum machines. This talk will give a gentle introduction to the basic concepts that underlie this quantum information revolution and describe recent remarkable experimental progress in the race to build quantum machines for computing, sensing and communication.\nPrerequisites: No prior knowledge of quantum mechanics is required!\n   ","date":"2021-04-19T00:00:00Z","image":"https://yaleqc.com/p/speaker-series-spring-2021/background_hu1b985ef13ee2df9aee4392d3ead09e9b_279945_120x120_fill_box_smart1_2.png","permalink":"https://yaleqc.com/p/speaker-series-spring-2021/","title":"Speaker Series (Spring 2021)"},{"content":"About We are going through an edX course titled \u0026ldquo;Quantum Cryptography\u0026rdquo; to gain knowledge and experience in the field.

Much more coming soon.\nQuantum Information  Physics 345: Introduction to Quantum Information Processing and Communication, Prof Steven Girvin  Who should take it: Anyone with a knowledge of complex numbers and introductory linear algebra. This course presents a very accessible and exciting foray into quantum information science. This is highly recommended to anyone looking to begin their journey with quantum computing, with or without a technical physics background. When is/was it offered: Spring 2021 What does it cover: Begins with a basic overview of quantum phenomena and covers the mathematical representation of quantum states as complex vectors, the superposition principle, entanglement and Bell inequalities, quantum gates and algorithms for quantum computers, quantum error correction, dense coding, teleportation, and secure quantum communication. The course also includes an introductory overview of how to use IBM Q.   Physics 660: Quantum Information and Computation, Prof Shruti Puri  Who should take it: This is effectively the graduate version of Phys 345, and should be treated as such. The audience spans advanced undergraduates to graduate students. That said, Prof Puri makes every effort to start from first principles, making this course accessible to undergraduates and even motivated non-Physics majors. When is/was it offered: Fall 2020 What does it cover: This course covers a wide range of topics ranging quantum circuits, universality, physical implementation of quantum operations, introduction to computational complexity, quantum algorithms, decoherence and noisy quantum channels, quantum error-correction and fault-tolerance, stabilizer formalism, error-correcting codes (Shor, Steane, surface-code, and others as time permits), quantum key distribution, quantum Shannon theory, entropy and data compression.    Experimental Physics  Physics 677: Noise, Dissipation, Amplification, and Information, Prof Michel Devoret  Who should take it: This is a difficult graduate course accessible to undergraduates with an advanced background in at least quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and electromagnetism. Some background in solid state physics and/or quantum many body theory could be helpful, but is not required. This should be taken by students interested in conducting experimental research in fields such as superconducting circuit quantum computing. When is/was it offered: Fall 2020 What does it cover: Physics explores phenomena displayed by simple systems through well-controlled experiments, whose results inform conceptual models. Central to these experiments are measurements of the system properties under varying conditions. In one form or another, measurements is performed by perturbing the system under study by a stimulus signal, and collecting the response signal. Acquiring the most precise information on a phenomenon of interest thus consists of maximizing the response signal and minimizing its accompanying noise. But what exactly is noise? Can noise itself have remarkable and worthwhile properties despite its fundamental uncertain character? How can we mitigate its effects? The aim of this graduate-level course is to answer these questions, with emphasis on the case where the origin of noise is thermal or quantum fluctuations. These fluctuations are unavoidable for a system under measurement, which is by essence open, and fundamentally different from closed system studied in undergraduate courses. The fundamental fluctuations affecting measurements cannot be addressed by ordinary filters or shields, and have to be faced head-on. Of particular interest are the fluctuations inherent in the control and signal processing of the experiment itself. Thus, dissipation and amplification, important effects in operations involved in the measurement and control chains, are ultimately linked to noise. The form of the link is the essence of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT), which was first uncovered by Einstein. Students will learn the concepts and main tools of the analysis of stochastic processes and information theory, through the exploration of FDT and all its main applications.

Terra provides a bedrock for composing quantum programs at the level of circuits and pulses, to optimize them for the constraints of a particular device, and to manage the execution of batches of experiments on remote-access devices. Terra defines the interfaces for a desirable end-user experience, as well as the efficient handling of layers of optimization, pulse scheduling and backend communication. Aer: Aer, the ‘air’ element, permeates all Qiskit elements. To really speed up development of quantum computers we need better simulators, emulators and debuggers. Aer helps us understand the limits of classical processors by demonstrating to what extent they can mimic quantum computation Ignis: Ignis, the ‘fire’ element, is dedicated to fighting noise and errors and to forging a new path. This includes better characterization of errors, improving gates, and computing in the presence of noise. Ignis is meant for those who want to design quantum error correction codes, or who wish to study ways to characterize errors through methods such as tomography, or even to find a better way for using gates by exploring dynamical decoupling and optimal control. Aqua: Aqua, the ‘water’ element, is the element of life. To make quantum computing live up to its expectations, we need to find real-world applications. Aqua is where algorithms for quantum computers are built. These algorithms can be used to build applications for quantum computing. Aqua is accessible to domain experts in chemistry, optimization, finance and AI, who want to explore the benefits of using quantum computers as accelerators for specific computational tasks.

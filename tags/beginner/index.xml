      <description>Status  About We are going through an edX course titled &amp;ldquo;Quantum Cryptography&amp;rdquo; to gain knowledge and experience in the field. Once a sufficient amount of fundamental concepts is learned, we will start to implement quantum network protocols for the Quantum Protocol Zoo, an open repository founded by our very own Shraddha Singh.

      <description>About We are exploring quantum error correction. We will start with the quantum repition code, and move into more complicated examples of quantum error correction. Every week, one project member will prepare a short presentation addressing that week&amp;rsquo;s topic. Each topic will be accompanied by a short weekly project, which will be a textbook problem, a qiskit exercise, or a challenge based on the last week’s presentation. A full introduction and background on this project can be found on our project proposal.</description>

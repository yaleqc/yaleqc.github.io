      <description>About We are exploring quantum error correction and investigating tools for simulating quantum control systems. A full introduction and background on this project can be found on our project proposal.
Team This project was originally proposed by faculty sponsor Dr. Steven Girvin and is lead by member Ben McDonough.
Current contributing members include:
 Sofia Fausone Katrina Kargioti Allen Mi  Special thanks to senior member Jean Wang for providing additional academic support and guidance.</description>

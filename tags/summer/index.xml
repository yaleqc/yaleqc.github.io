      <description>Information The 5th edition of the Quantum Computing Summer School at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is happening this summer. The Quantum Computing Summer School is an immersive 10-week curriculum that includes tutorials from world-leading experts in quantum computation as well as one-on-one mentoring from LANL staff scientists who are conducting cutting-edge quantum computing research. Summer school fellowship recipients will be exposed to the theoretical foundations of quantum computation and will become skilled at programming commercial quantum computers, such as those developed by D-Wave Systems, Rigetti, and IBM.</description>

      <description>About This project was started during the Spring semester of 2021, and the original project proposal can be found here. During this semester, a team of two members created a presentation on a topic related to quantum error correction each week. Going into the summmer, we will switch to a reading group format. Each week we wil have a reading addressing an aspect of quantum error correction. With the help of our graduate student mentor Alec, we will break down challenging topics, with the goal of gaining familiarity with the language and concepts of the field.</description>

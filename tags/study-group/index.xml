      <description>About We are exploring quantum error correction. We will start with the quantum repition code, and move into more complicated examples of quantum error correction. Every week, one project member will prepare a short presentation addressing that week&amp;rsquo;s topic. Each topic will be accompanied by a short weekly project, which will be a textbook problem, a qiskit exercise, or a challenge based on the last weekâ€™s presentation. A full introduction and background on this project can be found on our project proposal.</description>

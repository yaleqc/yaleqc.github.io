      <description>Director of Resources (2020-21) Mathematics and Physics, Class of 2021 LinkedIn, Github As a long-time enthusiast of quantum computing, I am incredibly excited that a club like YuQC now exists at Yale. I am really looking forward to meeting other people interested in quantum science, and getting to learn from them — as well as being able to share what I have learned during my years working in this area. Given that Yale is a world-leading institution for quantum information science, it is only fitting that we have a proper undergraduate club dedicated to this field — I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what this group gets up to!</description>

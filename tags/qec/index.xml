      <description>About We concluded the study group with our last meeting on 8/17/2021! We are looking forward to the next academic year, and look for a future iteration at the next YuQC meeting!
This is a study group that was started during the spring semester of 2021, and met weekly through August of the following summer. We would like to thank our graduate mentor Alec Eikbusch for his tremendous support of this group, fielding our questions in-person and over discord, and setting up meetings with postdocs and other graduate students who are actively working in this field.</description>

 Yale undergrad Quantum Computing was founded in October of 2020 and, in our first year, we&amp;rsquo;ve done quite a lot. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look back at our productive year!
Members As shown through data collected at our interest meeting, YuQC brought together students from across disciplines, school years, and experience levels.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cryptography</title>

      <description>About We are going through an edX course titled &amp;ldquo;Quantum Cryptography&amp;rdquo; to gain knowledge and experience in the field. Once a sufficient amount of fundamental concepts is learned, we will start to implement quantum network protocols for the Quantum Protocol Zoo, an open repository founded by our very own Shraddha Singh.

      <guid>https://yaleqc.com/p/quantum-error-correction-study-group/</guid>
      <description>About We concluded the study group with our last meeting on 8/17/2021! We are looking forward to the next academic year, and look for a future iteration at the next YuQC meeting!
This is a study group that was started during the spring semester of 2021, and met weekly through August of the following summer. We would like to thank our graduate mentor Alec Eikbusch for his tremendous support of this group, fielding our questions in-person and over discord, and setting up meetings with postdocs and other graduate students who are actively working in this field.</description>

      <description>About The goal of this project is to provide a quantum programming API that will help people who want to incorporate quantum speed-ups into their classical programs much easier.
This project aims to both create the infrastructure to communicate with quantum systems and to create with that same infrastructure. We hope that our efforts in building this can lead to inspiration and further advances with the use of quantum computing in the broader computer science community.</description>

      <description>Status qtcodes is published on PyPI with tooling to encode, decode and benchmark XXXX/ZZZZ surface code, XZZX surface code, and repetition code!
 About We are building Encoder and Minimum Weight Perfect Matching Graph Decoder tools for serveral Topological Codes we wish to implement in Qiskit Ignis.
Here is the Github repo: https://github.com/yaleqc/qtcodes
Here is a link to our project proposal.
Team The first iteration of this project was created by members Shantanu Jha &amp;lsquo;21, Henry Liu &amp;lsquo;21, Will Sun &amp;lsquo;22, Shraddha Singh (Grad), and Andy Ding (Grad).</description>

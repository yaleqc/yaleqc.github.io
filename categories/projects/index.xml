      <description>Status  About We are going through an edX course titled &amp;ldquo;Quantum Cryptography&amp;rdquo; to gain knowledge and experience in the field. Once a sufficient amount of fundamental concepts is learned, we will start to implement quantum network protocols for the Quantum Protocol Zoo, an open repository founded by our very own Shraddha Singh.

      <description>About We are exploring quantum error correction. We will start with the quantum repition code, and move into more complicated examples of quantum error correction. Every week, one project member will prepare a short presentation addressing that week&amp;rsquo;s topic. Each topic will be accompanied by a short weekly project, which will be a textbook problem, a qiskit exercise, or a challenge based on the last week’s presentation. A full introduction and background on this project can be found on our project proposal.</description>

      <description>About The goal of this project is to provide a quantum programming API that will help people who want to incorporate quantum speed-ups into their classical programs much easier.
This project aims to both create the infrastructure to communicate with quantum systems and to create with that same infrastructure. We hope that our efforts in building this can lead to inspiration and further advances with the use of quantum computing in the broader computer science community.</description>

      <title>Qiskit Surface Code Encoder and MWPM Decoder</title>
      <link>https://yaleqc.com/p/qiskit-surface-code-encoder-and-mwpm-decoder/</link>

      <guid>https://yaleqc.com/p/qiskit-surface-code-encoder-and-mwpm-decoder/</guid>
      <description>Status This open-source package was presented at the November 2020 Qiskit Advocate Demo Session and is pending official incorporating into Qiskit Ignis. Our immediate goal is to demonstrate the rotated surface code threshold point in simulation.
 About We are building a Surface Code Encoder and Minimum Weight Perfect Matching Decoder package for Qiskit Ignis.
Here is the Github repo: https://github.com/Phionx/qiskit_surface_codes
Here is a link to our project proposal.
Team The first iteration of this project was created by members Shantanu Jha &amp;lsquo;21, Henry Liu &amp;lsquo;21 and Will Sun &amp;lsquo;22 for IBM Qiskit Ignis.</description>
